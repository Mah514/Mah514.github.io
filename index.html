                <h1 id="about">Exercises That Fit You</h1>
                <h4>By Mahmoud Idlbi and Frederick Munro</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="first-letter">T</span>he Covid-19 pandemic has made it difficult for all of us to stay healthy.
                    As cities shut down gyms, outdoor sporting events, and even social gatherings, it has become increasingly difficult to go outside and stay active.
                    Lack of activity is proven to have serious consequences not only on the health of our bodies, but also on our mental health. Luckily, there is no 
                    shortage of online resources on exercises. But many of these exercises are not particularly suitable for aging adults whom some of which suffer from diseases
                    such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease. Hence, we would like to introduce Active Aging, a smart application that takes YOU into consideration
                    when designing your personalized exercise routine.
                </p>

                <h2 id="research">Our Research</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of our research to deliver an inclusive and accessible application, we looked at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines</a>
                    as well as applications targeting aging adults that are performing well in the app market to study the user's preferences. The applications we studied are <a href="https://www.dailyyoga.com/#/">Daily Yoga</a>, selected for the 2022's App Store Editor's Choice Awards, and <a href="https://fitonapp.com/">FitOn</a> which received
                    over 350,000 five-star reviews in the App Store. By observing common features amongst these applications, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/ui-design-for-older-adults">reviewing well written articles</a>, and following Apple's guidelines we came up with the following design strategies for our application.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Themes</h3>
                <p>
                    The User-Interface is centered on clarity and simplicity. The text's font and size are chosen to be legible and easy on the eyes for every device.
                    The icons in the application were chosen because they are precise, easily recognizable, appropriate, and subtle. The content is made to fill the screen, while the use of a blurry background
                    comfortably draws the user's attention to where it is required. Furthermore, transitions between screens provide depth as you navigate through content and are logically easy to follow.
                </p>
                <h3>Branding</h3>
                <p>
                    Branding is minimal throughout the application to avoid causing confusion to the user. The application's logo is displayed solely on the home screen.
                    Inside the application, all symbols and text serve only to relay or gather information to and from the user. As per Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, color from the app icon is used throughout the interface to provide context in the app.
                </p>
                <h3>Color</h3>
                <p>
                    A sharp contrast of color is used in the application to highlight boxes, text fields, and buttons. Furthermore, color is used in the application to differentiate between interactive elements and non-interactive elements; therefore making the application easier to understand and learn.
                    However, other visual aids such as text labels and glyph shapes are used to make the application accessible to individuals with visual disabilities or colorblindness.
                </p>
                <h3>App Icon</h3>
                <p>
                    Consistent with other components of Active Aging, the app icon embraces simplicity. It is designed to capture the essence of the application without overwhelming the user with overly complex shapes or details.
                </p>
                <h3>Buttons & Text Fields</h3>
                <p>
                    A common design strategy in FitOn and Daily Yoga is the use of relatively large buttons. Furthermore, both applications utilize icons in buttons (when applicable) along with text; making the purpose of a button easier to understand.
                    Alongside implementing this design strategy, we also use a filled button for the most likely action in the view to improve the user's experience.
                    <br>
                    Textfields contain hints in them to communicate their purpose to the user. As well as being easily identifiable through the use of glyph shapes and contrasting colors.
                </p>
                <h3>User Flow Diagram</h3>
                <p>By creating this workflow diagram, we set the direction we want users to go while using the app. We made sure to compartmentalize all the options inside a single dashboard. This allows the users to have one general navigation space,
                    keeping the design simple to use.</p>

                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>Below you will find our visual sketches. We focused on keeping the number of buttons as low as possible. We also made sure to make large buttons with big text to make them easy to read and understand.</p>
                <img class="charts" src="./images/sketches.jpg" />
                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                <p>Based off of our simple sketches, we designed a working visual prototype. Press on the following buttons to analyze and test it out.<br />The <strong>Layout</strong> button will open a link showing all the pages at once. This will
                    allow you to see a complete overview of the project.<br />The <strong>Visual protoype</strong> button will open an interactive version of the project. You will see one page at a time and be redirected to different pages based upon
                    buttons you press.</p>
