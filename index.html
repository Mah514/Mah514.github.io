                <p>
                    <span class="first-letter">T</span>he Covid-19 pandemic has made it difficult for all of us to stay healthy.
                    As cities shut down gyms, outdoor sporting events, and even social gatherings, it has become increasingly difficult to go outside and stay active.
                    Lack of activity is proven to have serious consequences not only on the health of our bodies, but also on our mental health. Luckily, there is no 
                    shortage of online resources on exercises. But many of these exercises are not particularly suitable for aging adults whom some of which suffer from diseases
                    such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease. Hence, we would like to introduce Active Aging, a smart application that takes YOU into consideration
                    when designing your personalized exercise routine.
