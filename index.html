                <h1>Stay Safe and Healthy With AI Fitness</h1>
                <h4>By Mahmoud Idlbi and Frederick Munro</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="first-letter">I</span>t can be difficult to find the motivation to exercise and stay health; and this
                    couldn't be any more true than in the case of the pandemic. As most cities shut down completely in an attempt to limit the spread,
                    many of us have been spending more and more time at home. This can have serious impacts on mental
                    and physical health; especially for the elderly. Therefore, it is perhaps more crucial than ever to exercise regularly and to stay
                    healthy. However, it can be difficult for the elderly to find exercises that are safe and appropriate for them without the help of a personal trainer.
                    AI can change this, our application uses advanced machine learning models to recommend exercises for everyone depending on their health status and conditions.
                    Furthermore, the application can provide real time form-feedback using only your phone's camera.
